			Based on the <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">works of Gabriele Cirulli</a>, 
			which was inspired by <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224">1024 by Veewo Studio</a>
			<br/>
			and conceptually similar to <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes by Asher Vollmer</a>.

			<strong>{ WORK IN PROGRESS }</strong>
			<br>
			Created by <a href="http://abhishekcghosh.github.io/">Abhishek Ghosh.</a>
			<br/>
			This code is developed from scratch but is identical in concept and created with an additional<br/>
			agenda of developing an extensible framework for experimenting with the game itself.
